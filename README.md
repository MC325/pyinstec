# PyInstec - The Instec Python SCPI Command Library

PyInstec is an implementation of the SCPI commands used to interact with Instec devices such as the MK2000B.
All basic SCPI commands, such as HOLD or RAMP, have been abstracted into Python functions for ease of use.
Before using this library, it is highly recommended that you read through the SCPI command guide to gain an understanding of what all relevant functions do.

- Download Page: https://test.pypi.org/project/instec/

## Documentation
Documentation for each function is provided with the python file instec.py.

## Installation
Currently, the library only supports Python versions 3.10 or later, but may change later on to support older versions. It has been tested on Windows 11 in the Visual Studio Code development environment.

The Instec library requires pyserial version 3.0 or later to work. pyserial can be installed by calling
```shell
pip install pyserial
```

After installing pyserial, the instec library can be installed.
Currently, the library is only available on TestPyPI. To install the library, run
```shell
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ instec
```

## Usage
To add the library to your python file, add the import

```python
import instec
```

then you can use the functions associated with the library.

### Connection

To connect to the MK2000/MK2000B controller, first choose whether to connect over USB or Ethernet, and setup the connection to the device over the desired connection type.
Then, instantiate the controller.

For USB:
```python
controller = instec.MK2000(instec.mode.USB, baudrate, port)
```
By default the baud rate and port are 38400 and 'COM3', respectively.

For Ethernet:
```python
controller = instec.MK2000(instec.mode.ETHERNET)
```

Then, to connect to the controller, simply call
```python
controller.connect()
```


If a connection is unable to be established, a RuntimeError will be raised.

After finishing a program, it is recommended to close the connection with the controller:
```python
controller.disconnect()
```

### Functions

All functions in instec.py are instance methods, meaning they must be called with an instance of the controller. For example,
to run a hold command at 50Â°C using the instantiated controller from above, you can call
```python
controller.hold(50.0)
```

### Enums

Unlike the original SCPI implementation, some functions will require enums instead of integers. For example, to set the
Cooling/Heating mode of the controller to Heating Only using SCPI commands, you would call
```shell
TEMPerature:CHSWitch 0
```

In Python, the same command would be
```python
controller.set_cooling_heating_status(instec.temperature_mode.HEATING_ONLY)
```

The hope is by using enums, it is more obvious what each value accomplishes and parameters are less likely to be incorrectly set.

All enums can be seen in the instec.py file and correspond with their respective integer values in the SCPI command guide.
