# PyInstec - The Instec Python SCPI Command Library

PyInstec is an implementation of the SCPI commands used to interact with Instec devices such as the MK2000B.
All basic SCPI commands, such as HOLD or RAMP, have been abstracted into Python functions for ease of use.
Before using this library, it is highly recommended that you read through the SCPI command guide to gain an understanding of what all relevant functions do.
